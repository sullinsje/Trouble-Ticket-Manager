## AI Disclosure
I used a combination of Gemini 3.0 Fast and Pro throughout development of this project. I primarily used it for assistance with debugging and CSS styling as I am not too skilled with CSS. This has helped me understand CSS a bit more, but I think I need to take an online course or something to really cement the knowledge. Another use case of AI was getting insight on the relationships between my Models. For example, I had to configure my Models to not perform a cascading delete when an entry was deleted since no entity is entirely dependent on another for existing (aside from join tables). Another use case was learning more about DTOs and how they will be useful in this project. I had been facing many issues with cyclical JSON references, and, when prompting AI on solutions and industry standards for REST APIs, learned that I should primarily be sending DTOs back on GETs. Since the DTOs have back references that are not full Models, we do not have these JSON loops. This also matches well with my Project Proposal and User Stories as I mentioned sending “optimized versions of Models for JSON”.
